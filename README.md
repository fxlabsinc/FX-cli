# FX-cli

Use the FX command-line tool, FX-cli, to run Fx jobs from a developer machine. Using FX-cli, you can execute jobs and override values for region, tags, environments and give a list of suite names to run.

FX-cli improves productivity when you're writing new tests and constantly making changes to the test suite files without actually check-in to version-control systems. Once the jobs are stable you can then check-in the new files and make them part of the larger job scopes.

## Before you begin
Use a version of FX-cli that is the same version as your FX-Cloud or FX-On-Premises. Using an older FX-cli with a newer server might produce errors.
